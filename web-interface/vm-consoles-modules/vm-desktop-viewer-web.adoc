.Procedure

. Click *Consoles*. The VNC console opens by default.
. Select *Desktop Viewer* in the drop-down list.
. Choose the nework interface you want to connect to from the *Network Interface* drop-down.
.. If the L2 network interface is chosen, you will need to install qemu-guest-agent on the VM.
